<p>A close friend of mine recently asked me for some design help with her new blog and after a lot of humming and hawing with a few false starts, we got on the right track and came up with a new identity &amp; logo for Ms. Domestic Darling. The logo was created by scanning a few sketches into the computer and using Adobe Illustrator to create a sharp, colorful, vector-based logo.</p>

<p>Check out her blog at <a href="http://msdomesticdarling.com">MsDomesticDarling.com</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>
