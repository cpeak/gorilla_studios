<p>Yahoo announced today a completely new design of Flickr. They completely overhauled the design and somehow now offer 1TB of storage for each user. Yes, you read that right, 1 Terabyte. I haven't had much time to play around yet, but it looks like they put a lot of thought into the overhaul. It seems all of my previous photos are 'too small' to be used for the new cover section at the top of my page - I'd like to find out what they deem big enough. Seems like they really pulled out all the stops. Hopefully this will breathe some life back into Flickr.</p>
