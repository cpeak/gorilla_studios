<p>I spent the weekend going over my backups and consolidating ten years worth of photography into one complete archive. I am glad that I have kept just about every single photo I have taken since 2003  - I made the decision when I got my first camera to keep everything so when I am back at home after a shoot I can go over what worked and what didn't, just like film. This strategy is starting to pay dividends in full, because now I have a ten year archive to sort through and see how far I have come in my photography. I wanted to share one of a handful of shots I took with my original Canon Powershot that re-ignited my passion for photography.</p>
