<p>I have been working since the beginning of the year to find the best way to sell my work both locally and online. I have been hesitant up to this point because I have not found any solutions that ensure you get a high quality print, framed or matted, affordably and reliably. I can't wait to start selling my artwork, and am looking forward to making it available. More updates soon!</p>
