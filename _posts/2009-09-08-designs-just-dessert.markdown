<p>It's safe to say that I am obsessed with design.  I mentally critique just about everything I see on a daily basis on how it's put together, how usable or readable it is.  I'm constantly nitpicking tiny details in web design and technology.  My girlfriend gets annoyed when I complain about my cellphone menu being laid out the way it is, or a web page design choice.</p>

<p>I came across a <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/designs-just-dessert">wonderful article on AIGA by Kenneth FitzGerald</a>
 comparing a Mac to a box of cake mix and design to dessert.  Its a thought-provoking read, definitely worth looking at.</p>

<div class="quote">&ldquo;I urge students to aspire to pastry chef status as graphic designers. They should select choice ingredients, carefully consider the utensils they employ and eschew default choices. This isn’t to run down cake mix product, which I often enjoy. It’s a satisfactory and convenient option when you want a treat. With a little embellishment, it can be especially tasty.&rdquo;</div>

<p>Enjoy</p>
