<p>I love when I get the chance to photograph bands in action, so here's a few things I have learned to keep in mind if you want to be successful in music photography.</p>
<h4>1. Know your gear</h4>
<p>This may seem obvious, but know your gear. <i>Really know your gear</i>. If you are fiddling with AF settings or looking at an exposure I guarantee you are going to miss shots. The faster you are in dialing in your exposure settings the more shots you are going to make. Good bands are high energy and you have to keep up. It's your job to make them look awesome and you can't do that if your stuck messing with your camera. Most importantly learn your Auto-Focus system. Can you change AF points quickly without taking the camera away from your face? Have you played around with your cameras quick AF settings? These are things you need to know if you want to keep up with an energetic front-man who is diving all over the stage, or trying to catch the drummers face between cymbals that keep moving all over the place.</p>
<p>Get your exposure dialed in with a few shots then focus on the show. I check exposure every now and then if I feel the lighting may have changed enough to impact exposure, but on the whole I am not checking my shots throughout a set. This comes from years of learning my camera and being able to change most functions blind-folded.</p>

<h4>2. Don't Machine Gun It</h4>
<p>Keep calm, don't run and gun it. I like to really listen to the music - when you start feeling the beat you can start to predict what some of the band members are going to do. Is the drummer building up tension? Is the bassist going to do some acrobatic trick at the crescendo? Feeling the music, staying cool, and taking your time will lead to some great photographs. If you have the chance talk to the band beforehand, get a feel for what kind of show they like to put on. Good bands love to show off for us photographers, a lot of times you'll get guys hamming it up for the camera, be ready for it, they don't wait for you.</p>
<h4>3. Keep Track Of Your Shots</h4>
<p>Be sure to get every band member if possible, don't spend time on the lead singer or one person in particular. Finishing a set with 1000 photos of the lead singer and 5 of the drummer is not going to look good when you are trying to show your results to them, or other bands. Variety is key.</p>
<h4>4. Composition</h4>
<p>This is another skill that is honed over time. Watch your composition like a hawk. Don't clip the guitarists headstock. Make sure the mic isn't covering too much of a singers face. Keep an eye on the background lights. Know your surroundings. It's little details that can make or break a photo.</p>

<h4>5. Prepare</h4>
<p>Save yourself the headache and avoid any future hearing loss problems by getting a nice set of earplugs. If you love shooting shows you are hopefully going to do it a lot, and keep doing it. Protect your hearing and wear earplugs.</p>
<p>Also Be sure to stretch before the show and if you can drink plenty of water during. Shooting concerts can be very physically demanding, so make sure you take care of yourself first. When I shoot shows I am stretching, bending, reaching, and crouching to get shots, and if I don't take time before the show to get limber then I pay for it the next day.</p>
<p>Last but not least, be ready and able to switch out gear on the fly. Its going to be dark, its going to be loud, and its going to be hectic. This is one reason I HATE SD Cards with a passion, they are very easy to drop or mishandle.  Practice changing lenses and memory cards quickly and cleanly. Know where your gear is and have it ready.</p>
<p>Above all else, have fun!</p>
