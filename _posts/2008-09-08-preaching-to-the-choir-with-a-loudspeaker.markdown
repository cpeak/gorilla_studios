<p>There is a fine line between advertisements and bombarding the viewer with annoying junk, and ESPN has gone the distance with the latter. I went to check on some football news on SportsIllustrated.com when I was greeted with a lovely growing astroturf ad for Monday Night Football that covered the WHOLE SCREEN. After grumbling and letting it load all the way so I could close it, I was delighted to see that there were also 3 ads for it again on the main page. Seriously ESPN? I'm pretty sure most football fans that go to SI.com to check football scores may have a vague clue that there are games on Monday night now, just a guess. Excuse me while I go put a pop up ad on the front page here to advertise for my site.</p>
