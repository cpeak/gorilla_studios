<p>A friend of mine recently purchased the new Canon EOS 5D MkIII and gave me a chance to check it out after dinner tonight. While this is not a full review, I wanted to share my initial thoughts. The camera feels absolutely solid, great to hold and the shutter release is extremely snappy. The large LCD panel on the rear of the camera is crisp and bright, photos looked amazing. What really blew me away was its low-light capabilities - I took a quick set of photos and was amazed at the clarity. Shots from ISO 12,000 up to the 25,600 max were clear, and certainly useable.</p>

<p>I really hope to get my hands on one for an extended period so I can do a full review, but for now I wanted to say that I am really impressed.  Soon I'll have a complete review with image and HD video samples, so stay tuned!</p>
