<p><a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2011/02/against-chrome-a-manifesto.html">Great blog post by Steven Poole</a> lashing out against virtual visual clutter in modern UI.</p>

<p>I disagree on his critisim of the iPad's iBooks reader though, while it is always in a perpetual middle of the book state, it fades to the background rather quickly when you get absorbed into the actual book itself.  Additionally, if you find yourself nit-picking the tiniest details of the software your using then the designers got all the huge important stuff right.</p>

<p>A bit extreme, but I enjoyed the post thoroughly.</p>
