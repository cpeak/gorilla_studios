<p>Since I am a total space geek I wanted to share an awesome, well-designed <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/07/21/138560459/sizing-up-space-a-visual-history">Space Shuttle info-graphic</a> that NPR put together. If you love that be sure to check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2VygftZSCs">Ascent</a> - a long slow motion HD breakdown of a shuttle launch from just about every angle possible with explanations of what your seeing. </p>
