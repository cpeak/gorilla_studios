<p>For a while now Gorilla-Studios has lead a secret double life - one standard PHP/HTML site along with a WP Powered site hidden behind the scenes.  Over the next few days I will be migrating the site over to a WP powered version.  I've decided to go with WordPress to save me some headaches with tracking posts, RSS Feeds, etc.  There are some downsides though, WP is built for beginners with little web experience, and since I make a living from web-development there are some WP functionalities &amp; practices that drive me up a wall.</p>

<p>However, the site should be gaining more and more functionality in the coming weeks, hope you enjoy.</p>
