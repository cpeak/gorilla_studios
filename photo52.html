  <p>My new project for 2014 will be a Photo52 challenge in which I will be taking at least one photo per week with the goal of it being on par with my portfolio work. While the <a href="/photo365.html">Photo365 Challenge I did in 2013</a> was mainly to get in the habit of carrying the camera every day and just going through the motions of capturing something daily, the Photo52 project will be more deliberate - I hope to go on more dedicated photo walks, take more time planning, composing, capturing and editing. At the end of the year I hope to have a fair amount of work I could easily include in my primary portfolio. I will also give brief notes about each weeks photos. Here we go again!</p>
  <h3>Week 1</h3>

  <p>Week 1 was a continuation of my series of silhouette shots I was getting from my train ride into the city every morning. My primary goal was the Sears Tower shot I had been working on, but I took this photo as we were passing through Forest Park. It doesn't have the sun bursting out like the others, and the blue tint of the train window really made this photo work.</p>
