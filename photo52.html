    <p>My new project for 2014 will be a Photo52 challenge in which I will be taking at least one photo per week with the goal of it being on par with my portfolio work. While the <a href="/photo365.html">Photo365 Challenge I did in 2013</a> was mainly to get in the habit of carrying the camera every day and just going through the motions of capturing something daily, the Photo52 project will be more deliberate - I hope to go on more dedicated photo walks, take more time planning, composing, capturing and editing. At the end of the year I hope to have a fair amount of work I could easily include in my primary portfolio. I will also give brief notes about each weeks photos. Here we go again!</p>

    <p>Week 1 was a continuation of my series of silhouette shots I was getting from my train ride into the city every morning. My primary goal was the Sears Tower shot I had been working on, but I took this photo as we were passing through Forest Park. It doesn't have the sun bursting out like the others, and the blue tint of the train window really made this photo work.</p>

    <p>This week I ventured out after work to one of my all time favorite Chicago subjects, The Sears Tower. I love how every angle presents a different look at the tower allowing you to keep going back for something different every time. For this particular photo I went to the top of the parking deck just across the street to the east where the 5th floor gives un-interrupted access away from all of the pedestrian traffic below. This was taken at 19mm which still was not enough to get everything, but I like how it turned out. The clouds were flying by at quite a clip, so a 60 second exposure smoothed them out. In color the sky was a brilliant pink with the yellow lights of the building dominating the exposure, but I prefer the high-contrast black and white here.</p>
