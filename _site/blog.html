                    <p>My favorite photo for March has to be a very quick shot from Union Station in Chicago. I was a little early for my train so I decided to go up to one of the balconies overlooking the main hall. I had intended to slow my shutter down enough to capture some of the motion from everyone hurrying in and out of the hall but I did not have my tripod. Attempts to use the railing while shooting around 1/10th or 1/8th were unsuccessful, but this shot at f/4.5, ISO 100 for 1/20th was sharp and had no camera shake. Overall I love the photo - in particular the one woman in the foreground seems to stand out to me. I was interrupted when a bride and her photographers came up to the balcony for some shots, however I was more than happy to get out of their way.  I will eventually go back with my tripod and get some long exposures but for now I am happy with this one.</p>

<p>I have been working since the beginning of the year to find the best way to sell my work both locally and online. I have been hesitant up to this point because I have not found any solutions that ensure you get a high quality print, framed or matted, affordably and reliably. I can't wait to start selling my artwork, and am looking forward to making it available. More updates soon!</p>

                    <p>Two months down, still going strong. This month I spent a lot of time out hiking through various forest preserves in the area so my favorite photo this month came from Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in Darien, IL. I found these waterfalls along a small creek that winds its way through the southern section of the park. A graduated ND filter kept a balanced exposure between the sky and foreground, and a circular polarizer filter cut back reflections from the water to reveal all the rocks and little details underneath. Using both of these also allowed me to extend my exposures up to 2 seconds. I plan on going back in the summer to get one from in the water, but for now its just a bit too cold.</p>

                    <p>I am 52 days into my Photo365 challenge and have already gotten a few people asking me almost the same questions about the project, so I thought I would explain a little bit more about why I am doing this exercise and what my guidelines are.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> - A number of reasons, some of which are: Staying sharp by taking at least one photo every day, keeping my camera on me at almost all times (I <i>hate</i> that feeling when I wish I had it), to push myself to try different styles I normally wouldn't shoot, and also it acts as a photo diary for the year.  Im looking forward to having all 365 in a gallery, I have kicked around ideas about what to do with the final set, but more on that later in the year.</p>
<p><strong>Do you really take and post one photo a day?</strong> - I try to take at the very least one photo per day, but also limit myself to no more than 36 if its not a photo walk or specific shoot. The main point of the limit is so I don't keep second guessing or trying the same shot over again. I want to see the bad shots as well as the good.  I try to post the photo on the same day, but if I have to wait until morning I am okay with that.</p>
<p><strong>How much time per day?</strong> - Like I said I usually limit myself to a handful of shots, the average seems to be about 5-10 per day. I also limit myself to three minutes of photoshop touchup for any given photo.  I have a timer set and when beeps, thats it. I try to get the best photo I can straight from the camera - however I have been playing around with some alternate edits I usually don't try like half-saturation and stylized filters.</p>
<p><strong>What have you learned so far?</strong> - I have noticed that I am looking around for photo opportunities a lot more than I used to. It was difficult getting into the habit of bringing my SLR everywhere, but my Black Rapid strap really helps with that - I just sling it over my shoulder and head out. I like to see the progress I have made, and I also like seeing the good shots contrasted with some of the bad. I can see days where I just wasn't feeling very creative, and then others where I wish I could have posted a lot more.</p>
<img src="/images/pod/53_full.jpg" />
<p>Here is the photo from today, February 22nd.  I simply walked a few blocks out of my way after work and took a handful of shots as I went. I was quite surprised at how this one came out. Allowing myself three minutes for editing I spent most of the time adjusting the highlights &amp; color temp, and staying true to the limit I didn't get a chance to straighten the composition.</p>
<p>Remember to keep shooting and have fun.</p>

                    <p>I spent the weekend going over my backups and consolidating over ten years worth of photos into one complete archive. I made the decision when I got my first camera to keep everything so when I am back at home after a shoot I can go over what worked and what didn't, just like film. This strategy is starting to pay dividends in full, because now I have a ten year archive to sort through and see how far I have come in my craft. I wanted to share one of a handful of shots I took with my original Canon Powershot S200 that re-ignited my passion for photography.</p>  
<img src="/images/archer.jpg" />
<p>Taken on August 3rd, 2003 in downtown Chicago on one of my first photo walks. I vaguely recall trying very hard to capture some long night-time exposures with a point and shoot, and looking back on the roll I didn't do too bad considering the limitations of the camera. This was from the tail end of the walk - <i>The Spearman</i> is a large bronze statue from 1928, one of two guardians (the other being <i>The Bowman</i>) standing watch at Congress &amp; Michigan Ave in the loop.</p>

                    <p>One month into the Photo365 challenge and I feel it has been going very well so far. The goal when I started wasn't to produce portfolio-worthy images every day - it was mainly to keep practicing my craft while pushing myself to step outside my comfort zone and shoot things I normally wouldn't. Some days were harder than others, but overall it has been thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>A few shots stand out more than others, but the one that caught the most attention was actually completely random.  On January 24th I had to walk from one client to another in the middle of a rather blustery Chicago snowstorm.  I had a vague idea of how to get from A to B, but didn't have a specific route in mind. I just started walking and snapping pictures as I went. A few turns in the general direction I found myself in front of a row of very interesting looking townhomes in the River North neighborhood. Thankfully nobody was parked in front so I took a quick photo and kept walking. </p> 
<img src="/images/pom_january.jpg" />
<p>The image was captured at f9.5 at 1/90, ISO 100. I intentionally kept my shutter speed down to catch the snow swirling in front of the lens. I was not sure of exactly how it would show up after processing, but I love how it turned out. I'm undecided if this one will make it to print or portfolio, but it looks beautiful as a desktop image on my Cinema Display. One month down, eleven to go!</p>

                    <p>I hear a lot of less-experienced photographers bemoaning the fact that they don't have a particular lens, or their camera 'isn't good enough', and it always frustrates me. You don't need the latest 20+ Megapixel camera to produce great images. Keep practicing with the gear you have, and more importantly push yourself and try something you've never done before. For my Photo 365 project I decided to try to catch a droplet splashing out of water but I don't have a ring flash or enclosed soft-box - heck my tripod was in the trunk of my car with my wife at work.</p>
<p>Necessity is the mother of invention so I grabbed some things in the kitchen and setup a mini-studio. I used a glass of water, an eye dropper, a lamp as a secondary light, my flash &amp; sync cable, and ...a chopstick?</p>
<img src="/images/experiment.jpg" />
<p>I set the camera up on a plastic tupperware container as a makeshift tripod and switched over to manual focus mode since nothing would be moving. Looking through the camera I couldn't tell if I was in focus on the center of the water's surface, so I dipped the chopstick in dead center and focus locked on that.  I grabbed my cable release in one hand and the eye dropper in the other and tried to sync the drop to the shutter.  At first I tried the built-in timer but couldn't get the droplet to hit at the right time, so I resorted to dropping multiple drops not too far apart and releasing the shutter during.  It only took me a few shots to get the timing down. About 10 minutes of setup and a few minutes of shooting and I captured this one:</p>
<img src="/images/droplet.jpg" />
<p>Its not going to appear in any magazines thats for sure, but then again it was about 15 minutes with no additional equipment. No high-speed camera, no special lighting, just what I had in my camera bag and kitchen. <i>f</i>/19, 1/200th, ISO 100. This was just an experiment, I like to tinker around. Next time I will probably distill the water first so its free of impurities, and I may try a larger container so I can get more of a horizontal shot. I only spent a few minutes tinkering around in the kitchen, but I already have a better understanding of macro-photography setups, and how I can improve next time.</p>
