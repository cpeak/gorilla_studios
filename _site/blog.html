      <div class="post">
        <p>My favorite photo in August came from Cruise Nights in downtown Westmont, IL. <a href="http://cadillaccasanovas.com">The Cadillac Cassanovas</a> are a great three piece rockabilly band from the Chicagoland area who put on a great show who I was lucky enough back in May to shoot at the Arcada in St. Charles. So when I saw that they were playing not far from me, I knew I had to grab the camera and head over to see them. This particular shot serves as an example of sticking to it and not leaving until the show is over, your cards or full, or your batteries are dead. The event was in front of a really ugly brick building with a really distracting banner behind them and people walking all over, needless to say it wasn't the greatest venue to shoot at. Their first set was probably around 7, and in broad daylight. Really hard light, poor shooting conditions, and super hot so I wasn't really happy with too many shots. I got a few but overall nothing compared to the Arcada show. During the break between sets I walked around checking out the cool cars and cooling off a little bit, and almost decided to go home. Thankfully I didn't.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to meet the guys backstage at the Arcada show so I really try to do my best to get some great images for them, but I just wasn't feeling it that night. However, I decided to stick with it and see what I could get in the second set. As the sun started going down their stage lights started to take over as the primary light source. Using a faster shutter speed I started blackening out the background which was full of distractions. This particular photo is a portrait of the Cassanovas bass player Rick Uppling. Rick is a great musician and always fun to photograph since he's usually jumping around, standing on his huge upright bass, or just generally hamming it up for the audience. The stage lights were to his left creating a great backlight that highlighted the edges of his face, creating a wonderful edge silhouette. While shooting I was careful not to cut off the headstock of his bass, as well as try to get both hands in shot. Framing can be tricky when photographing musicians in concert, especially guitarists and bassists.</p>

</figure>
<p>Their stage lighting setup was casting a bunch of different color all over the place, so the color version of this photo was really strange looking. I ran it through Silver Efex Pro to convert it to black &amp; white and thats when the photo really jumped. My only critique is that I caught the lead signer &amp; guitarist Carl's headstock poking into the left side of frame. Overall I love this portrait and am really thankful that I stuck with it that night. Be sure to check their <a href="http://cadillaccasanovas.com">website</a> to see when the Cassanovas will be rocking near you.</p>

      <div class="post">
        <p>Back in June I finally retired my first digital SLR - an extremely trustworthy Canon EOS 10D which I purchased brand-new in the summer of 2003. Despite being so old, I continued to shoot with the 6.3MP crop-sensor DSLR when most people were scrambling to trade in their 5DMkII's for new Mark III's. I knew that camera like the back of my hand, through and through. It served for years as a shining example of why you don't need to rush out to buy the latest gear to get great images. I looked it up and realized that when I purchased it, Canon's line-up of DSLR's consisted of the 1D and 10D - thats it. Most of my favorite portfolio shots came from that camera, and I bet if you look at my <a href="/portfolio.html">galleries</a> you couldn't pick out which ones were shot with that 6.3MP 10D, my new 20.2MP 6D, or the 5DMkIII I was lucky enough to take on vacation.</p> 
<p>I really don't like reading reviews of brand new camera gear or technology, I prefer to wait until it's been used in the real world for some time before I start forming an opinion on it. For example when I worked in the IT industry a few years ago the first round of solid-state hard drives were starting to hit the market - reviews were proclaiming that they were the second coming! They reported that the drives were fast and more importantly extremely durable. While this holds true to most new drives these days, the first generation drives from multiple manufacturers started failing pretty spectacularly about 6 months into real-world usage. Personally I don't care how amazing a camera performs right out of the box, how sharp a lens is from the factory. Show it to me a year or two down the road when its been used for weddings every weekend, or out on a photo trip to Africa, is it still as good?</p>
<p>Okay, so why am I up on my soapbox this time? I just never see reviews for gear thats been used in the field, so thats what I would like to start doing. Sure, taking a look back on an extremely worn camera thats 10 years old doesn't really provide much value other than to speak volumes about the brand, but in a month or two I plan on writing a post about how my Kata SLR/Laptop bag has held up being hauled around day to day as well as travelling around the world with me. But for now, lets see how 10 years of wear and tear took its toll on one of Canons earlier digital SLRs.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/10d-retire.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Canon EOS 10D</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After 10 years of abuse the camera is still in decent shape. The only functional problem with it was that the primary shutter button was starting to flake out, which for normal landscapes is not a big deal, but when you are trying to track a Great Blue Heron in flight you need it to work 100% of the time. I can't even guess how many exposures the shutter had on it, but it was probably significant. The only issue I had with the shutter was an ERR99 once back in 2006, but never it happened again. Towards the end the camera would lock up every now and then, requiring me to pull the batteries and put them back in.</p>
<p>At sometime in 2010 one of the arms on the eye cup that keep it in place snapped so it wouldn't stay on. Other than that, its got some scratches and wear marks but thats it. It's held up like a tank, and most of the damage is purely cosmetic.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/10d-retire2.jpg' />

</figure>
<p>This camera just shows the quality the Canon brand delivers. Ten years is a very long time for any piece of equipment, let alone something as high-precision as an SLR. Its been at my side while sloshing around rivers, knee deep in snow, sudden downpours, freezing nights, and hot summer days. I love this camera, and while I'm sad it's going up on the shelf, I am excited to see what kind of adventures my new EOS 6D will have with me.</p>

      <div class="post">
        <figure>
  <img src='/images/silverfx2.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Silver Efex Pro 2 by Google.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I have spent the past two weeks playing around with <a href="http://www.niksoftware.com/nikcollection/usa/intro.html">The Nik Collection</a> by Google, which is comprised of Silver Efex Pro 2, Dfine 2, Viveza 2, HDR Efex Pro 2, Color Efex Pro 4, and Sharpener Pro 3. They are a set of tools to provide you with a wider array of options when it comes to color correction, black and white conversion, noise reduction and more.  The main reason for downloading the free trial was to play around with Silver Efex which comes highly recommended from a few pro photographers I follow. I wasn't expecting miracles from the software, but I was hoping to be impressed enough to purchase the package and integrate it into my workflow, which I am always looking to improve.</p>
<p>Downloading was a breeze and installation was as simple as any application on the Mac, so there were no issues there. When you open up an image in Photoshop you get a fairly jarring popup window with links to launch each of the programs in the package. I would have liked to see Google integrate the visuals better for Photoshop somehow, but I may just be nitpicking.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I took a photo at sundown of the Chicago skyline from just north of the city right on Lake Michigan. The original had a wonderful mix of purples and oranges, combined with the white and yellow lights from the city itself. I thought this would be the perfect candidate for a black &amp; white conversion, so it became my first test subject. I pulled it up in Photoshop and launched Silver Efex.</p>
<h3>Silver Efex Pro 2</h3>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/silver-efex-full.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Silver Efex Pro 2 Application Window.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was initially surprised by the number of pre-set filter options but as I quickly surfed through them my level of excitement diminished. I would say a good half of them were unusable with the default settings, but the other half presented some interesting options. I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to editing so I shy away from super highly edited or stylized photos (which is also why I am starting to lose faith in the HDR-fest known as 500px.com). Im sure the filters I immediately dismissed could be adjusted to provide useable results since there is a large number of settings available. Also my sample size of trying three photos is woefully inadequate to establish a good sense of how the program can perform under different circumstances. On the bright-side I am very happy with how fine-grained the settings can get giving pixel-obsessed photographers a fresh new playground they can run wild in.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/silver-options.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Silver Efex Pro 2 Options Panel.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here is part of the options window for Silver Efex. The number of settings is truly impressive. You can adjust brightness by highlights, mid-tones, and shadows, there are multiple contrast options, structure, tonality, color filters, grain, sensitivity, the list goes on and on. I think I could spend a month or two learning just Silver Efex and not know everything available to me. A cursory search online and I found multiple resources for tutorials and guides to help you get the most out of the software, so documentation and help are certainly not lacking.</p>
<h3>Color Efex Pro 4</h3>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/color-efex.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Color Efex Pro 4 Application Window.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Color Efex Pro 4 was extremely similar to Silver Efex so I am not going to try not to repeat myself. Some great options right out of the box, but some looked over the top and silly (my opinion of a lot of Instagram photos as well). Again, the options are fantastic and you can tweak a photo to your hearts desire. Before I took the photo I used with Silver Efex, I snapped this one of a man just enjoying the late afternoon on Lake Michigan. The original photo itself was a bit lack luster. I loved the composition, but the colors were washed out and it just felt dull compared to how wonderful it looked from behind the lens. Color Efex let me bring out the sky and lake a little more and gave the image a little more punch. It's not an award winner by any means, but I am pleased that I was able to use the software to enhance an otherwise throw-away photo and make it something at the very least I can enjoy.</p>
<p>The options for Color Efex are just as robust as Silver Efex. They do change depending on which filter you have selected, but again the options are extremely fine-grained giving you almost limitless flexibility for color-balancing and color-adjustments.</p>
<h3>Sharpener Pro and Dfine 2</h3>
<p>I haven't had the chance to play around with either of these yet, but I am looking forward to running them through their paces before my trial runs out. Sharpener Pro claims to 'bring out hidden details consistently', while Dfine is a noise reduction program 'tailored to your camera'. I am naturally skeptical but very open-minded, so I will share my thoughts when I take a deeper dive into the other half of the collection.</p>
<h3>Initial Impression</h3>
<p>Overall I am very pleased with the Nik Collection so far, and when I have a bit more spending cash will plop down the $149 to purchase the entire suite. Google seems to have hit a sweet spot where out of the box you can get some great results without much fiddling, yet the rabbit hole is there so more advanced users can dive down and explore as much as they want. I wish I had more than 15 days for the demo, but even just using it for two weeks I feel that $149 is a good price for what you get. When I make the purchase and learn more I will be sharing more thoughts, so be sure to stay tuned.</p>

</figure>
<p>My favorite shot this month was certainly a departure from what I normally like. This was taken on a lunch break while walking around soaking up some sun. I snapped this photo of an apartment building on Adams St. and instantly noticed that from that particular angle no lines were straight up and down. The brick columns were askew, the street lights att odd angles, all creating a strange scene guiding your attention all over the place. I normally like all my photos at perfect 90 degree angles and try my best to correct for the Keystone Effect when shooting skyscrapers (very common living in Chicago) so to say this was outside of my comfort zone is a bit of an understatement.</p>

      <div class="post">
        <p>Back in May I was lucky enough to fly out to London to attend the Future of Web Design conference and while I was there I had some free time to explore with my camera. I flew out of Chicago on Friday afternoon, arriving very early on Saturday morning. I was delighted to find that after an eight hour flight it was a breeze figuring out my way into the city. I dropped my luggage off at the hotel because I couldn't check in until later, took my camera gear and headed out. Finding your way around is pretty tricky because roads in London change names every few blocks, thankfully I am pretty good at directions and figured out my way with only a few hiccups. An unplanned nap at Starbucks recharged my batteries (many thanks to the staff for letting me rest!), and I found my way down to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. I scouted out both sides of the river and just soaked in the scenery for at least an hour or two waiting for the sun to start going down before taking photos.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/london-travelogue/tower-bridge.jpg" />
  <figcaption>A rainy sunset at Tower Bridge, London<span>5", f/22, ISO100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are two beautiful parks on either side of the river, so I was torn on which to shoot from. This first shot was a 30 second exposure at f/16 with an ND filter, taken on the north side of the Thames with the Tower of London just behind my back. I was hoping to get more lights and have the river a bit more glassy, but the weather was getting pretty poor and a few shots after this it started dumping rain and blowing wind pretty hard. My umbrella lasted a few minutes so I scrambled to pack my gear and seek shelter.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/london-travelogue/bishopsgate-a10.jpg" />
  <figcaption>After the rain, Bishopsgate Road, London<span>5", f/13, ISO100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After watching it rain for ten minutes under the base of the bridge a Policeman shooed us away since the park was closing so I ran for the nearest tube station. I was completely soaked but my gear was in good shape - my Kata bag came with a rain cover which kept everything nice and dry. I wish I could say the same about me. Once the storm front rolled through I made my way up Bishopsgate Road towards my hotel. I snapped another long exposure just to capture the vibrancy and color of the city after the rain.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/london-travelogue/leddenhall-market.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Leadenhall Market, Bishopsgate Road, London<span>0.5s, f/6.3, ISO200</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While walking back to the hotel I stumbled across Leadenhall Market which is a beautiful open-air market filled with small shops specializing in wine, cheese, chocolate and more. I stopped a few more times over the weekend but unfortunately it was closed every time. I took some shots Saturday night before retiring back to the hotel but this particular photo was taken the next morning. It was a bit difficult balancing the sunlight from the skylights and the lamps overhead, but a half-second exposure at f/6.3, ISO 200 seemed to do the trick. I loved the feel of the shops with all the flags overhead and the cobblestone walkway and the skylights overhead, I just wish I could have seen it full of people.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/london-travelogue/westminster.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Westminster Abbey, London<span>1/200th, f/10, ISO200</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sunday morning after stopping at Leadenhall Market I made my way by tube down to Westminster and Buckingham Palace. I was surprised at how densely packed the tourists were clustered around each of the landmarks. Being from Chicago and always being slightly annoyed by them I tried my best to stay away from the crowds. I wanted photos that were distinctly my own, and not the typical tourist shots I have seen a million times before. The morning was gloomy to say the least, but thats not always bad when it comes to photography. I circled Westminster Abbey once looking at the beautiful architecture before deciding where to shoot from. There was a small park adjacent to the main bell towers that everyone seemed to be ignoring. Making my way over I took this photo, which I didn't have a lot of hope fore since it was so flat in color. It wasn't until I converted it to black and white that the contrast made it really pop.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption class='vertical'>Westminster Abbey architectural details, London<span>1/90th, f/8, ISO100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I could probably spend a week just shooting the Abbey itself but I only had 2 days to cover as much of the city as I could. Before leaving I wanted to get at least some of the stunning details of Westminster itself. Here is a shot from the back of the Abbey, the entire building is covered in ornate decoration, this was above one of the back entrances. The main statue is probably four feet tall, the rows of figures above it maybe ten inches each. I can only imagine how long it took to craft just this entrance alone, let alone the entire building.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/london-travelogue/guard.jpg" />
  <figcaption class='vertical'>A palace guard marching down Birdcage Walk near Buckingham Palace<span>1/90th, f/5.6, ISO200</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the Abbey I walked over to Buckingham Palace which was a tourist nightmare. I snapped a few photos but was disappointed that the palace guards were probably 50 yards behind the wrought iron gates so we couldn't get close. I had read that you could get close and personal with them at the Palace of St. James but I couldn't find them. A walk around Hyde Park and back around I heard marching music and a lot of commotion headed my way. I headed in the direction of the music and was pleasantly surprised to come across a small parade. A large contingent of Palace Guards in their bearskin helmets came marching by followed closely by a large number of thoroughly british gentlemen in bowler hats, three-piece suits, and black umbrellas. If I had seen it on TV my first thought is that it was some Monty Python sketch, but sure enough, there they were. Im still not sure what the parade was about and for some reason it didn't occur to me to ask anyone. I liked this exposure because while playing around with the settings as they walked by, I slowed the shutter down just a hair to capture some motion blur. The guards arms are starting to blur and there is a hair of movement on his medals, but his head was steady. What a fun sight it was.</p>

</figure>
<p>Monday was spent at the conference, but afterwards I made my way back to Westminster. My goal that night was to shoot the London Eye and Elizabeth Tower - most people incorrectly call 'Big Ben', which is the name of the bell inside the tower itself. Like I said before I try not to take typical tourst photos, but I did want to catch a double decker bus at some point. Monday evening was the best weather I had seen since arriving, the sun was starting to sink, basking the tower in beautiful golds and purples, making for some elegant looking shots. I was taking some longer exposures along the Victoria Embankment when a big red bus came rumbling down the street. I snapped this one just as it went by, one of my favorites from the trip. The tower is framed nicely with the Union Jack fluttering to its side, the double decker bus is just recognizable as it streaks by.</p>

</figure>
<p>The sun sank lower into the sky so I made my way over to the bridge to set up for another angle. I was delighted to find a Scottish Bagpiper playing for donations, the note in his case saying he was a former soldier asking for 1 pound if you take photos. I snapped some photos and watched him play, then flipped him a 2 pound coin and thanked him.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>As golden hour set in a ton of photographers started setting up along the bridge over the Thames, all pointed at the tower. I was mildly disappointed to find that the closest corner of the building didn't have any lights on, creating a very large dark section. Beggars can't be choosers so I kept shooting, capturing this photo. Timing was key here as traffic wasn't that heavy - I had to time my exposures to start after the stoplight turned green allowing the backed up traffic to move towards me instead of sitting and waiting. I took a number of photos from this vantage point, but I picked this one because of the reflection from a bus created an interesting set of light trails on the left side of the frame. </p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/london-travelogue/london-eye.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Sunset at the London Eye on the Thames River<span>25", f/20, ISO100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I always say when a group of photographers are looking one way, always at least take a look behind them to see what they are missing, and sure enough thats what I did to capture my favorite image of the trip. Turning around I found the disappearing sun casting a deep blue and purple sky over the Thames river and London Eye. A 30 second exposure blurred out boat traffic on the river and grabbed just enough motion on the ferris wheel. The hotel to the right of the Eye had illuminations that changed colors every minute or so, cycling between blues, yellows, purples, and greens, all adding to the mixture of colors in this scene. The fine details of the exposure are lost here on the screen, but I can't wait to see this one in large format print soon.</p>
<p>Overall the few days I had to explore London went as well as they could have. I got some beautiful shots despite the weather and can't wait for my next trip out. I may post another travelogue, but if you want to see some more shots from the trip, check out my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.197839947031736.1073741833.175762829239448&type=3">Facebook gallery</a>.</p>

<p>My personal favorite from June was taken while I was out in California for a few days on a business trip. We had stopped into Anchor &amp; Hope in downtown San Francisco, an amazing seafood restaurant. While waiting for lunch to be served a line cook was shucking oysters behind the main counter. The sun shone in through the skylights and lit him like a spotlight. I wish I had more time to capture the shot, or maybe a wider lens, but I still enjoyed how it came out. I love the decor - with the fun painted fish on the walls and the interesting lamps jutting out, the counter littered with dishes, everything combined to create a visually interesting scene.</p>

<p>Despite a detour to Iowa for an hour or so and wave off on final approach both due to a massive storm over Chicago, I couldn't complain about my view at sunset.</p>
