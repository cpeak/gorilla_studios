  <h2><a href="/2014/01/07/sears-tower-sunburst">Sears Tower Sunburst</a> <span class="date">&raquo; 07 Jan 2014</span></h2>
  <p>As previously mentioned I have recently been taking a few photos every morning during my commute into the city trying to get a certain shot which I haven't posted until now. The window to get the shot was literally around 1 or 2 seconds long, so I had to be very careful with my timing. As the UPW train starts its wide turn into the loop the sun passes right behind the Sears Tower, giving me very little time to get the shot - about 1 frame with the sun on the south side, a few while its directly behind, and once on the north side.</p>
<p>The first two days I tried from the upstairs seats but was shooting through a tinted window - while this worked for a few shots, specifically my <a href="2014/01/02/photo-of-the-month/">December Photo of the Month</a>, for this particular instance it just wasn't working. On the third day I went downstairs into the vestibule in the center of the car where the windows don't have any tint and are generally cleaner for some reason. I ended up with this version which I am very happy with.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption class='light full'>Sears Tower Sunburst<span>55mm, f/6.3, ISO100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I was able to get the sun just as it was dissapearing behind the tower with minimal effects from the sun. Some earlier shots looked like something out of Star Trek with a ton of lens flaring, but I really perfer the subdued version with just the beams. Without the window tint the sky was a beautiful rich almost baby blue, and the sun cast a slight yellow on the steam arising from the various buildings in the skyline. It could be cropped a little tighter but I do like the silhouetted buildings adding a bit of interest in the foreground.</p>

  <p>Here are my 12 'Photo of the Month' selections for my Photo365 Challenge in 2013. Looking back at the selections I realize only February and August were roughly planned shots taken when I specifically went out for a shoot, otherwise they were all improvised. It was a perfect split 6 color and 6 black &amp; white, and to my surprise 7 of them were vertical, with only 5 horizontal shots. I had a lot of fun shooting all year and am looking forward to the next batch.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2014/01/02/photo-of-the-month">Photo Of The Month</a> <span class="date">&raquo; 02 Jan 2014</span></h2>
  <p>My final Photo of the Month was a shot that inspired a small collection of photos that I will post soon. I was riding the Metra and decided to keep my camera out to see if I could find anything creative that was right under my nose every morning. I take the Union Pacific West line which heads directly east into the city and early in the morning the sun is particularly low in the sky allowing for some really creative shots. I snapped this one as the sun was directly behind a crossing signal, creating a really striking silhouette.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>December Photo of the Month - Train Signal<span>100mm, 1/640s, f/6.3, ISO100</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I typically hate shooting through the Metra windows because they are scratched, dirty, and usually tinted some really awful 1970s orange or green. Although I found having the sun right behind my subject exaggerated the green tint creating an extremely saturated background to the completely solid black foreground.</p>
<p>On the same trip in I got a shot of the sun passing behind the Sears Tower, along with a handful of other photos, but none quite as striking as this one. I made three more attempts of the Sears shot (as well as one attempt with my iPhone for a fun comparison), which I will post along with the others soon.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2014/01/01/hello-2014">Hello 2014!</a> <span class="date">&raquo; 01 Jan 2014</span></h2>
  <p>What a busy year it's been and yet I know for certain that 2014 will be even busier. In 2013 I got to travel a bit - London for a week and San Fransisco for a few days, I finished my <a href="photo365.html">Photo365 Challenge</a>, invested in some new equipment including a Canon 6D, spent a lot of time reading books &amp; blogs and listening to photo podcasts, completely rewrote and launched the lastest version of the website, and most importantly hopefully have grown as a photographer.</p>
<h3>Photo365</h3>
<p>The biggest project this year was my Photo365 challenge - the goal of which was to have my camera on me at all times and make myself take at least one photo per day all year long. The motivation was part journalistic, part learning but mostly pushing myself to stick with it and keep practicing. Surprisingly I didn't struggle until maybe October or November when I really had to focus to get something. It became harder to find something unique to photograph - commuting downtown every day and going through my usual routine made it difficult to branch out - hence the myriad of train related photographs. I took different routes to and from the train station but I was still in the city during the day and in my apartment at night. The weekends were a lot easier, but there were a lot of nights around 10 or 11 when I realized I didn't take anything that day and had to scramble.</p>
<p>Overall I am very pleased with how the project turned out. Having my camera on me every day allowed me to take some great photos that I normally would have missed but on the other side when I wasn't feeling very creative or was busy I had some absolute duds. I decided to be honest and put the bad ones up as well so I could see my progress throughout the project, the benefit being when I saw them mixed in I would remember why they didn't work or what went wrong. I also wanted to do as little post-processing as possible so the gallery stays honest to what was captured in camera.</p>
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>To say that 2014 will be the biggest year of my life is a bit of an understatement. I will be moving to London in a few months for at least one year, there are a lot of things brewing for Gorilla-Studios.com, and even more things in my personal life. At my day job personal quarterly goals are set so we can track our progress as craftsmen and I would like to apply this principal to this part of my life as well - I highly recommend this to anyone, especially this time of year. These are the four areas I will be focusing on this year in terms of my photography:</p>
<h4>Photo730 / Photo52</h4>
<p>So I have one photo per day over the last year, but I would like to continue this. I want to mix it up a bit - I will be continuing the photo per day, but I plan on using my iPhone to document this year. This doesn't mean I am putting down my 6D though - I now plan to go out once a week to take more focused photos that might make their way into my portfolio. I think I'll get higher quality work by slowing down a bit, planning a little more, and being able to take time to capture what I want.</p>
<h4>Expanding Gorilla-Studios</h4>
<p>Gorilla-Studios technically turned 10 this year. I originally launched the site on December 12th, 2003 and thankfully don't have any screenshots or archives of it because I'm sure it was horrid. It has grown over the years, been torn down and re-written multiple times as I continued to grow as a photographer and web designer, finally becoming what it is today. However all this work will not cease - I have plenty of ideas for growing the site coming in 2014. Plenty to announce, but now is not the time!</p>
<h4>London</h4>
<p>The major shift in my life is that my wife and I are packing up and moving to London in just a few months. To say this is a great opportunity as a photographer is the understatement of the century. I spent a week in London back in May, but most of my time was consumed with a conference for work. Now that I have the opportunity to reside there for at least a year I am salivating at the chances I will have to expand my portfolio and meet some great new people. I want to focus more on street photography and learn more about telling a story with one photo, I have always admired photographers who have more of a journalistic approach. I will also share my experiences as an American photographer living overseas - it's a perspective that I haven't seen before so I plan on writing about it quite extensively. More details in the next few weeks about my plans.</p>
<h4>Learning</h4>
<p>Above all else I want to keep pushing myself as a photographer, learning new techniques, ideas, and perspectives. I am making the jump to Adobe Lightroom after 10+ years of a Photoshop-based workflow so this will be an interesting transition. I also plan to focus more on Travel and Street photography considering we will be in Europe all year.</p>
<p>I plan on keeping tabs on my goals every quarter to see how I am doing so I can make changes as needed. I can't wait to see what 2014 brings, and hope everyone has an exciting year as I will.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2013/12/20/light-pollution">Light Pollution</a> <span class="date">&raquo; 20 Dec 2013</span></h2>
  <p>Do you live in a urban area or close to a city and have too much light pollution for good night photography? I love long exposures of star trails and night skies, but since I live near Chicago it's next to impossible to view stars let alone take any photos. Previously I would look at Google Maps to plot where I might drive to by looking for sparse areas, but even then its a guess as to how much light pollution there is in the area.</p>
<p>Luckily I found a tool called <a href="http://www.blue-marble.de/nightlights/2012">Blue Marble</a> which overlays nighttime satellite images onto Google Maps allowing you to plot where the best spots for stargazing would be.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/light-pollution.jpg' />
</figure>
<p>As you can see above, Chicago and its surrounding counties are completely worthless. To find a suitable spot I have to drive at least a few hours, and for spectacular night skies I think Nebraska is the closest location. Check out where you live and find the best spot near you to haul out your photo gear and or telescope.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2013/12/10/why-i-dont-machine-gun">Why I Don't Machine Gun</a> <span class="date">&raquo; 10 Dec 2013</span></h2>
  <p>Over the weekend read an article on some random photo site about bad habits photographers make. I won't cite the article because when I went back to find it, it popped up word for word on 3 different sites so I have no idea who actually wrote it (thats a rant for another day). Anyway, one of the points was 'Luck Shooting', or spraying and praying as some photographers call it. It really got me thinking about how I shoot concerts and candid photography. So much of what I do relies on anticipating the perfect moment to capture, not just hammering the shutter button and hoping I get something useable.</p>
<p>A good photographer gets a sense of whats about to happen, your gut starts telling you to wait for the best possible moment, you just start knowing whats going to happen. In psychology getting to this point can be likened to the final stage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence">Four Stages of Competence</a>. At first you don't recognize the deficit of knowledge regarding a skill or task, then realize that you don't know how to perform said task, moving into knowing but having to actively think about performing it, finally the task is performed without thinking - having become an expert.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to hone this skill. I first realized it was something I needed to work on when I would shoot candid photos and people would look really strange when they were talking or performing a physical activity. I progressed as a photographer and a few years later I was taking photos at a picnic of coworkers playing kickball, where I found myself talking through the motions, actively thinking about how they were going to wind up for the pitch, how their body would move, where the ball might go, etc. Now after shooting countless portraits, concerts, and talks I am to the point where I don't even think about it actively - at talks I wait for the speaker to gesticulate energetically and smile instead of capturing a boring photo of them at a podium mid-sentence. Portraits and headshots I always take a few frames before telling a joke so I can capture the best photo of the shoot right as their laughing is subsiding yet they are still smiling ear to ear. At concerts I am watching the bassist haul his guitar up on his knee as he shouts out to the crowd to my left I know he is going to look back my way in a second or two, his head quickly pivots and I snap two frames.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/music/bass.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Anticipate your shot, feel whats coming next</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I honed this skill over years behind the lens. I listen to the beat of the drummer and feel when the big crescendo of the song is coming. Sometimes, especially with children, it has to be a split second decision as something magical happens. I try to talk to speakers before they go on to see if they will be entertaining or more reserved.</p>
<p>One of my all time favorite photos was taken so quickly but I knew instantly what I had got. My friends and I were out taking photos of the Bean in Millenium Park one fall evening. I was shooting some longer exposures to get a touch of motion blur to accentuate how busy the park was as the sun was starting to set. Out of nowhere a wedding party appeared just outside of the frame to my right - suddenly the bride and groom stepped into frame as the photographer was gathering everyone. There was a quick kiss but she was completely behind him. Had I started spraying at that moment I would have been looking down at the camera and missed what happened next. The groom took her hand and just as I locked focus on him he raised his arm with hers. I knew he was going to spin her, but she was still behind him. I paused a split second and as their arms completed the motion she twirled out from behind. I opened the shutter exactly once and I knew instantly that he was in focus but since I was dragging the shutter she was going to blur a bit capturing the spin perfectly. As soon as his hands were coming down the entire wedding party entered the scene completely blocking the happy couple. The window was less than a few seconds. I anticipated the shot, took it at the right moment and got exactly what I wanted.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/portfolio/dance.jpg' />
  <figcaption>I had one chance and the window was less than 2 seconds</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Machine gunning photos is bad photography with so many downsides. Your memory card is going to fill up really fast with crap images and while you are looking through the last ten you rattled off I guarantee you are missing the next great shot. If you are in a quiet environment like a wedding or conference where that shutter cranking away is going to distract and annoy a lot of people. If you practice and actively think about the shots you are going to take it is going to improve your photography. When you have to grind through actively thinking about timing, lighting, framing, and exposure, you will know it through and through and it will become second nature. You are going to stop firing off 10 photos then looking down to see if you got something. You'll pop off a shot or two and just know you got something great, and let me tell you, thats a great feeling.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2013/12/01/photo-of-the-month">Photo Of The Month</a> <span class="date">&raquo; 01 Dec 2013</span></h2>
  <p>My favorite photo from November was taken from the 80th floor of the Aeon Center in downtown Chicago. I am lucky enough to shoot my company's yearly software craftsmanship conference and this year provided some spectacular sunsets. I was wrapping up at the end of the first day and packing my gear when I saw a few people going to the west side of the building and pulling out their phones. I hurriedly got my tripod out and was able to snap some longer exposures right as the sun was dipping below the horizon. The photo was an 8 second exposure at f/16.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption class='vertical'>November Photo of the Month - Chicago sunset<span>19mm, 1/200th, f/16, ISO100</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The picture looks fantastic and I got a lot of positive feedback on it from various places, but I am still disappointed that the window was rather dirty. At larger sizes you can see streaking and image distortion around the Sears Tower which I hope I can lessen or remove in Photoshop, but that will be a lot of work.</p>
<p>I can't believe I only have a month left for the Photo365 challenge. I've kept with it the best I can, but its been getting difficult to post every day. I still have my camera on me, but as it gets colder its getting much more difficult to get out over lunch or take a longer walk after work to get some good images. I just have to brave the cold for another few weeks and I will have hit my goal! Time to keep shooting.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2013/11/15/first-time-lapse">Time Lapse From Aeon Center</a> <span class="date">&raquo; 15 Nov 2013</span></h2>
  <p>Every year my company hosts the <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org">Software Craftsmanship North America conference</a>, a gathering of professionals in the software industry, located atop the Aeon Center in downtown Chicago. I am lucky enough to be the primary photographer for the two-day event which means I get the chance to soak in the fantastic views from the 80th floor when I am not running around shooting the conference. Since the event is held mid-November each day ends with superlative views of the sun setting over the Chicago skyline. The first night I was able to setup my tripod and get some great still frames like the one below, but I realized this would be the perfect opportunity to make a stunning time-lapse. Only problem is I have never done one.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/aeon-sunset.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Sunset from the 80th Floor, Aeon Center, Chicago <span>19mm, 8s, f/16, ISO100</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basics of time-lapse photography is taking photos at set intervals and stitching them together afterwards to create the a video of stills, the standard rate being 30 frames per second of video. I had a cable release, but it was analog so I couldn't set it to fire at specific intervals - I would have to shoot tethered to the computer. To do so you must install Canon's EOS Utility Software, which *requires* your disc that came with the camera (I'll rant about the inability to download directly from Canon). The utility allows you to control the camera over USB through the computer - allowing live view, focus controls, basic camera functions, as well as continuous interval shooting.</p>
<p>My goal was a longer video, of about 30 seconds, and at 30 frames per second I was going to need to capture 900 photos. I set it to shoot every second, dumping the photos to an external HD attached to my laptop so I wouldn't fill up the cameras SD card. Since I was shooting the sun going down I set the camera to Aperture Priority Mode, dialing it in to f/16. I assumed that since the lighting was going to shift a great deal the camera could recognize that and adjust the shutter speed accordingly. Everything looked great, so I started the series and went about my business.</p>
<p>I would poke my head in every few minutes to make sure everything was going well, and for the first 10-15 minutes everything looked great. I had wanted to catch the sun going down, disappearing, then the city lights coming on as magic hour set in. Unfortunately about 5 minutes after sunset I started looking at some of the exposures and noticed that the ISO was maxed out to 12500 and they were looking terrible. The camera thought it was supposed to be a normally light daylight shot, and therefore started cranking the ISO to get as much light as possible - this was the exact opposite of what I wanted. I had hopped that it would start taking longer and longer exposures, leaving the sky dark and bringing the city lights up as they turned on.</p>
<div class='youtube'>
  <iframe width="520" height="415" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9sZw3pE0lDE?vq=hd720" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>I knew I wasn't going to get exactly what I wanted, but I hoped at least the first portion would be usable. I found a good point to stop at just after the sun dips below the horizon. I batch converted the RAWs into JPGs so I could compile them into a movie. To make the actual movie I found a free utility called <a href="http://www.dayofthenewdan.com/projects/time-lapse-assembler-1/">Time Lapse Assembler</a>. You can choose your target frame-rate, codec to encode with and a few other options. Once the processing finished I got about 11 seconds of okay footage. Its a bit darker than I had hoped for, but overall I'll call it a success. Even though I didn't get the whole lapse I wanted it was a great learning experience. I think my next attempt I will bump the intervals to every 5 seconds and play with the exposure compensation to see what happens. I won't get another chance to shoot from Aeon again until next November, but I will definitely be ready by then.</p>
