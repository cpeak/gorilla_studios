      <div class="post">
        <p>Every year my company hosts the <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org">Software Craftsmanship North America conference</a>, a gathering of professionals in the software industry, located atop the Aeon Center in downtown Chicago. I am lucky enough to be the primary photographer for the two-day event which means I get the chance to soak in the fantastic views from the 80th floor when I am not running around shooting the conference. Since the event is held mid-November each day ends with superlative views of the sun setting over the Chicago skyline. The first night I was able to setup my tripod and get some great still frames like the one below, but I realized this would be the perfect opportunity to make a stunning time-lapse. Only problem is I have never done one.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/aeon-sunset.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Sunset from the 80th Floor, Aeon Center, Chicago <span>19mm, 8s, f/16, ISO100</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basics of time-lapse photography is taking photos at set intervals and stitching them together afterwards to create the a video of stills, the standard rate being 30 frames per second of video. I had a cable release, but it was analog so I couldn't set it to fire at specific intervals - I would have to shoot tethered to the computer. To do so you must install Canon's EOS Utility Software, which *requires* your disc that came with the camera (I'll rant about the inability to download directly from Canon). The utility allows you to control the camera over USB through the computer - allowing live view, focus controls, basic camera functions, as well as continuous interval shooting.</p>
<p>My goal was a longer video, of about 30 seconds, and at 30 frames per second I was going to need to capture 900 photos. I set it to shoot every second, dumping the photos to an external HD attached to my laptop so I wouldn't fill up the cameras SD card. Since I was shooting the sun going down I set the camera to Aperture Priority Mode, dialing it in to f/16. I assumed that since the lighting was going to shift a great deal the camera could recognize that and adjust the shutter speed accordingly. Everything looked great, so I started the series and went about my business.</p>
<p>I would poke my head in every few minutes to make sure everything was going well, and for the first 10-15 minutes everything looked great. I had wanted to catch the sun going down, disappearing, then the city lights coming on as magic hour set in. Unfortunately about 5 minutes after sunset I started looking at some of the exposures and noticed that the ISO was maxed out to 12500 and they were looking terrible. The camera thought it was supposed to be a normally light daylight shot, and therefore started cranking the ISO to get as much light as possible - this was the exact opposite of what I wanted. I had hopped that it would start taking longer and longer exposures, leaving the sky dark and bringing the city lights up as they turned on.</p>

  <iframe width="520" height="415" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9sZw3pE0lDE?vq=hd720" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>I knew I wasn't going to get exactly what I wanted, but I hoped at least the first portion would be usable. I found a good point to stop at just after the sun dips below the horizon. I batch converted the RAWs into JPGs so I could compile them into a movie. To make the actual movie I found a free utility called <a href="http://www.dayofthenewdan.com/projects/time-lapse-assembler-1/">Time Lapse Assembler</a>. You can choose your target frame-rate, codec to encode with and a few other options. Once the processing finished I got about 11 seconds of okay footage. Its a bit darker than I had hoped for, but overall I'll call it a success. Even though I didn't get the whole lapse I wanted it was a great learning experience. I think my next attempt I will bump the intervals to every 5 seconds and play with the exposure compensation to see what happens. I won't get another chance to shoot from Aeon again until next November, but I will definitely be ready by then.</p>

      <div class="post">
        <p>My Photo of the Month from October was a quick headshot for my co-worker Connor who completed his residency to become a Craftsman at 8th Light. I take all the bio photos for our website, so I am lucky enough to get everyone in front of my camera when they come on board. I love doing natural light portraits but they can be tricky in our office - which is a mix of fluorescent and incandescent bulbs combined with very tall windows that let natural sunlight pour in at certain points during the day.</p>
<p>Since these are small photos for our website I can't dedicate much time to them, the shoots are usually no more than a few minutes a piece. Connor was very comfortable in front of the camera which made things really easy. It was mid-morning so the light was coming in from the windows to camera left. I also lined him underneath a hanging light to create some highlighting from above which added a nice detail to the top of his head. We have a gorgeous chalk wall that Stephanie spent a lot of time on which, when blurred out creates a fun texture behind the subject. The arrow in the right of the frame adds a little cheekiness pointing back at Connor, business portraits don't always have to be straight laced. The mix of natural light and an incandescent bulb overhead makes for a little more editing to balance out the color temperature but overall I love the lighting.</p>

</figure>
<p>My Canon 50mm 1.8 is my go-to lens for portraits since it is tack-sharp around 2.8 or 3.5. It allows me to shoot at a comfortable distance from the subject, but a bonus is that when I want to fill the frame I can take a few steps forward and say '..and now to make you a bit more uncomfortable' which usually always solicits a good smile and laugh. When getting your subject to laugh be sure to snap right after the initial 'burst', the best frames are just as the laugh is dying down to a good smile. I always try some serious shots and some basic posed smiling, but the best ones are always the candid laugh. Thanks for being a good sport Connor!</p>

      <div class="post">
        <p>It has been over nine months since I bought my <a href="http://www.kata-bags.us/3n1-33-dl-for-dslr-w-long-range-zoom-lens-5-6-lenses-flash-ktdl-3n1-33">Kata 3N1-33 Sling Backpack</a> so lets take a look at the bag and how it's held up through daily usage so far...</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/kata.jpg" alt="Kata 3N1-33 Sling Backpack" />
<figcaption>Kata 3N1-33 Sling Backpack</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Initially I made the purchase because I need to carry a laptop every day for work and am still in the thick of my <a href="/photo365.html">Photo 365 Challenge</a>. The main compartment of the bag is comprised of a number of velcro sided dividers that can be configured to fit whatever gear you may have. I can easily fit my EOS 6D and with battery grip paired with a 70-200 2.8 in the center, with room for 4 or 5 lenses. My typical daily setup consists of 3 lenses, my filters, and a Canon 430EX flash (with diffuser). I sacrifice a lens slot to accomodate the grip side of the SLR body, otherwise its just a bit too tight for my comfort.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/kata-inside.jpg" alt="Kata 3N1-33 Sling Backpack" />
<figcaption>Inside the main section of the Kata 3N1-33</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Above is the bag laying on its back, photographed from above. The bottom 'row' sits at the very bottom of the pack. The compartment is zippered to allow access from either right or left sides. I have my 50mm Macro lens, my filters and filter holder, and my small 50mm 1.8 tucked in the corner. Directly across from the body on the left side of the bag is my old zoom lens. The top row consists of my 430EX Flash with room for its diffuser, as well as another slot for a lens. The very last lens spot has been inverted to make room for the grip side of the SLR body. The lens sections are very deep and really meant for professional grade glass. Kit and small body lenses tend to wander around the bag if you're not careful. For example the 50mm 1.8 is a tiny lens, and if I don't stuff the Kata rain cover (included with the bag) with it, it will usually jump out of its slot which makes me very nervous. I have never had problems with anything falling out of the bag when opening, and the whole thing is generously padded so it holds up to daily use with ease. Its been with me to work every day as well as my London and San Francisco trips.</p>
<p>It's an extremely rugged bag meant for heavy outdoor use. Kata proudly advertises its versatility as both a regular backpack and a sling bag. The straps can unclip and clip back to either side, allowing you to sling it over either shoulder. I don't use it as a sling bag, but having it over one shoulder allows me to simply swing it around my front giving me full access to the main portion of the bag for quick lens changes or accessing other gear without putting the bag down. It came with an additional rain cover which has kept my gear nice and dry while commuting during the rainy Chicago spring (and fall) this year.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/images/kata-top.jpg" alt="Kata 3N1-33 Sling Backpack" />
<figcaption>Inside the top section of the Kata 3N1-33</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The top of the bag has plenty of general storage for extra gear, as well as a zippered pouch which I keep my wired remote, my wireless flash triggers, extra memory cards, and other small items. The open area is perfectly sized for my lunch and a bottle of water (I doubt they had that in mind, but it's a great perk. You can also see the slot for the laptop which will easily accommodate laptops up to 17 inches.</p>
<p>The bag is very comfortable even fully loaded. The straps are wide and very well padded, and there are two great handle straps on either side of the top of the bag. Im not sure if it's their purpose, but I slide two tripod legs through them to hang it off one side. My only two complaints are very minor which speaks volumes to the quality of the bag. One is the small strap that keeps the laptop from sliding out of the sleeve - I find myself closing the top of the bag and getting the zipper hung up on it, having to flip it back into the bag before closing the top (I admit its a minor annoyance). The other is the fact that the left shoulder strap is black on both sides while the right is white on the underside. This is meant as a visual clue for the sling feature - the tabs where the straps click in on the bottom of the bag are the same way but on opposite sides, letting you know you can click the left strap to the right side (white to white), and vice-versa. My problem is that over nine months of daily use the white part of the strap has turned an ugly dark grey.</p>
<p>Overall the bag is still almost new, with no wear on it whatsoever. I feel very secure carrying my gear and laptop in the bag and rarely have any fears of damaging equipment. I would highly recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a high-quality SLR/Laptop (or just SLR) bag.

        <p>My Photo of the Month from September was a macro shot I snapped one morning on the way to the train station. I have been so busy with work and other things on my plate its been very difficult to keep up, but I have stuck with the 365 challenge so far. Even though I have been running around like mad, I love this shot I grabbed in only a minute or two during my commute. The leaves in late September are just starting to turn in the Chicagoland area and this particular one caught my eye as it laid on the ground. I love the brilliance of the color combined with the texture, I had to fill the entire frame with it, which was not particularly hard because this leaf was about the size of my hand!</p>

      <div class="post">
        <p>Over the weekend I got to shoot Just Enuff playing the Monee Fall Festival, and had a great time. I provided the band with the best photos from the day which they used on their site and their Facebook page. Monday morning I got a few messages from various people saying that Hofner Bass was using my photo as their cover photo on their Facebook page. Sure enough when I pulled up the page, there's one of my photos, cropped to hell right on the bass guitar that Mike was playing.</p>
<figure>

<p>Now I have had a few days to reflect on it and im still just not sure to feel about this. I know a lot of photographers would be livid about having their worked ripped off and not being attributed, but on the other side its a Facebook cover photo that it seems they change daily. I'm bummed that nobody contacted me before, or since, but thats just the way it is. My wife tried plugging my work in the comments, and from what I understand they would plug me if I sent them more work, so thats always an option. Overall I think I'm mainly dissapointed I didn't get a higher quality shot of the bass itself. I usually snap some close-ups of the instruments but they are usually kind of boring. I'll certainly keep this experience in the back of my head next time around so I can reach out to the instrument companies and maybe pick up some work.</p>

      <div class="post">
        <p>My favorite photo in August came from Cruise Nights in downtown Westmont, IL. <a href="http://cadillaccasanovas.com">The Cadillac Cassanovas</a> are a great three piece rockabilly band from the Chicagoland area who put on a great show who I was lucky enough back in May to shoot at the Arcada in St. Charles. So when I saw that they were playing not far from me, I knew I had to grab the camera and head over to see them. This particular shot serves as an example of sticking to it and not leaving until the show is over, your cards or full, or your batteries are dead. The event was in front of a really ugly brick building with a really distracting banner behind them and people walking all over, needless to say it wasn't the greatest venue to shoot at. Their first set was probably around 7, and in broad daylight. Really hard light, poor shooting conditions, and super hot so I wasn't really happy with too many shots. I got a few but overall nothing compared to the Arcada show. During the break between sets I walked around checking out the cool cars and cooling off a little bit, and almost decided to go home. Thankfully I didn't.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to meet the guys backstage at the Arcada show so I really try to do my best to get some great images for them, but I just wasn't feeling it that night. However, I decided to stick with it and see what I could get in the second set. As the sun started going down their stage lights started to take over as the primary light source. Using a faster shutter speed I started blackening out the background which was full of distractions. This particular photo is a portrait of the Cassanovas bass player Rick Uppling. Rick is a great musician and always fun to photograph since he's usually jumping around, standing on his huge upright bass, or just generally hamming it up for the audience. The stage lights were to his left creating a great backlight that highlighted the edges of his face, creating a wonderful edge silhouette. While shooting I was careful not to cut off the headstock of his bass, as well as try to get both hands in shot. Framing can be tricky when photographing musicians in concert, especially guitarists and bassists.</p>

</figure>
<p>Their stage lighting setup was casting a bunch of different color all over the place, so the color version of this photo was really strange looking. I ran it through Silver Efex Pro to convert it to black &amp; white and thats when the photo really jumped. My only critique is that I caught the lead signer &amp; guitarist Carl's headstock poking into the left side of frame. Overall I love this portrait and am really thankful that I stuck with it that night. Be sure to check their <a href="http://cadillaccasanovas.com">website</a> to see when the Cassanovas will be rocking near you.</p>

      <div class="post">
        <p>Back in June I finally retired my first digital SLR - an extremely trustworthy Canon EOS 10D which I purchased brand-new in the summer of 2003. Despite being so old, I continued to shoot with the 6.3MP crop-sensor DSLR when most people were scrambling to trade in their 5DMkII's for new Mark III's. I knew that camera like the back of my hand, through and through. It served for years as a shining example of why you don't need to rush out to buy the latest gear to get great images. I looked it up and realized that when I purchased it, Canon's line-up of DSLR's consisted of the 1D and 10D - thats it. Most of my favorite portfolio shots came from that camera, and I bet if you look at my <a href="/portfolio.html">galleries</a> you couldn't pick out which ones were shot with that 6.3MP 10D, my new 20.2MP 6D, or the 5DMkIII I was lucky enough to take on vacation.</p>
<p>I really don't like reading reviews of brand new camera gear or technology, I prefer to wait until it's been used in the real world for some time before I start forming an opinion on it. For example when I worked in the IT industry a few years ago the first round of solid-state hard drives were starting to hit the market - reviews were proclaiming that they were the second coming! They reported that the drives were fast and more importantly extremely durable. While this holds true to most new drives these days, the first generation drives from multiple manufacturers started failing pretty spectacularly about 6 months into real-world usage. Personally I don't care how amazing a camera performs right out of the box, how sharp a lens is from the factory. Show it to me a year or two down the road when its been used for weddings every weekend, or out on a photo trip to Africa, is it still as good?</p>
<p>Okay, so why am I up on my soapbox this time? I just never see reviews for gear thats been used in the field, so thats what I would like to start doing. Sure, taking a look back on an extremely worn camera thats 10 years old doesn't really provide much value other than to speak volumes about the brand, but in a month or two I plan on writing a post about how my Kata SLR/Laptop bag has held up being hauled around day to day as well as travelling around the world with me. But for now, lets see how 10 years of wear and tear took its toll on one of Canons earlier digital SLRs.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/10d-retire.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Canon EOS 10D</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After 10 years of abuse the camera is still in decent shape. The only functional problem with it was that the primary shutter button was starting to flake out, which for normal landscapes is not a big deal, but when you are trying to track a Great Blue Heron in flight you need it to work 100% of the time. I can't even guess how many exposures the shutter had on it, but it was probably significant. The only issue I had with the shutter was an ERR99 once back in 2006, but never it happened again. Towards the end the camera would lock up every now and then, requiring me to pull the batteries and put them back in.</p>
<p>At sometime in 2010 one of the arms on the eye cup that keep it in place snapped so it wouldn't stay on. Other than that, its got some scratches and wear marks but thats it. It's held up like a tank, and most of the damage is purely cosmetic.</p>
<figure>
  <img src='/images/10d-retire3.jpg' />
  <figcaption>Canon EOS 10D</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This camera just shows the quality the Canon brand delivers. Ten years is a very long time for any piece of equipment, let alone something as high-precision as an SLR. It's been at my side while sloshing around rivers, knee deep in snow, sudden downpours, freezing nights, and hot summer days. I love this camera, and while I'm sad it's going up on the shelf, I am excited to see what kind of adventures my new EOS 6D will have with me.</p>

<p>I have spent the past two weeks playing around with <a href="http://www.niksoftware.com/nikcollection/usa/intro.html">The Nik Collection</a> by Google, which is comprised of Silver Efex Pro 2, Dfine 2, Viveza 2, HDR Efex Pro 2, Color Efex Pro 4, and Sharpener Pro 3. They are a set of tools to provide you with a wider array of options when it comes to color correction, black and white conversion, noise reduction and more.  The main reason for downloading the free trial was to play around with Silver Efex which comes highly recommended from a few pro photographers I follow. I wasn't expecting miracles from the software, but I was hoping to be impressed enough to purchase the package and integrate it into my workflow, which I am always looking to improve.</p>
<p>Downloading was a breeze and installation was as simple as any application on the Mac, so there were no issues there. When you open up an image in Photoshop you get a fairly jarring popup window with links to launch each of the programs in the package. I would have liked to see Google integrate the visuals better for Photoshop somehow, but I may just be nitpicking.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I took a photo at sundown of the Chicago skyline from just north of the city right on Lake Michigan. The original had a wonderful mix of purples and oranges, combined with the white and yellow lights from the city itself. I thought this would be the perfect candidate for a black &amp; white conversion, so it became my first test subject. I pulled it up in Photoshop and launched Silver Efex.</p>

<p>I was initially surprised by the number of pre-set filter options but as I quickly surfed through them my level of excitement diminished. I would say a good half of them were unusable with the default settings, but the other half presented some interesting options. I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to editing so I shy away from super highly edited or stylized photos (which is also why I am starting to lose faith in the HDR-fest known as 500px.com). Im sure the filters I immediately dismissed could be adjusted to provide useable results since there is a large number of settings available. Also my sample size of trying three photos is woefully inadequate to establish a good sense of how the program can perform under different circumstances. On the bright-side I am very happy with how fine-grained the settings can get giving pixel-obsessed photographers a fresh new playground they can run wild in.</p>

You can adjust brightness by highlights, mid-tones, and shadows, there are multiple contrast options, structure, tonality, color filters, grain, sensitivity, the list goes on and on. I think I could spend a month or two learning just Silver Efex and not know everything available to me. A cursory search online and I found multiple resources for tutorials and guides to help you get the most out of the software, so documentation and help are certainly not lacking.</p>
<h3>Color Efex Pro 4</h3>

<p>Color Efex Pro 4 was extremely similar to Silver Efex so I am not going to try not to repeat myself. Some great options right out of the box, but some looked over the top and silly (my opinion of a lot of Instagram photos as well). Again, the options are fantastic and you can tweak a photo to your hearts desire. Before I took the photo I used with Silver Efex, I snapped this one of a man just enjoying the late afternoon on Lake Michigan. The original photo itself was a bit lack luster. I loved the composition, but the colors were washed out and it just felt dull compared to how wonderful it looked from behind the lens. Color Efex let me bring out the sky and lake a little more and gave the image a little more punch. It's not an award winner by any means, but I am pleased that I was able to use the software to enhance an otherwise throw-away photo and make it something at the very least I can enjoy.</p>
<p>The options for Color Efex are just as robust as Silver Efex. They do change depending on which filter you have selected, but again the options are extremely fine-grained giving you almost limitless flexibility for color-balancing and color-adjustments.</p>
<h3>Sharpener Pro and Dfine 2</h3>
<p>I haven't had the chance to play around with either of these yet, but I am looking forward to running them through their paces before my trial runs out. Sharpener Pro claims to 'bring out hidden details consistently', while Dfine is a noise reduction program 'tailored to your camera'. I am naturally skeptical but very open-minded, so I will share my thoughts when I take a deeper dive into the other half of the collection.</p>
<h3>Initial Impression</h3>
<p>Overall I am very pleased with the Nik Collection so far, and when I have a bit more spending cash will plop down the $149 to purchase the entire suite. Google seems to have hit a sweet spot where out of the box you can get some great results without much fiddling, yet the rabbit hole is there so more advanced users can dive down and explore as much as they want. I wish I had more than 15 days for the demo, but even just using it for two weeks I feel that $149 is a good price for what you get. When I make the purchase and learn more I will be sharing more thoughts, so be sure to stay tuned.</p>

<p>After posting shots from my visit to the Tall Ships exhibit at Navy Pier last week I was contacted by the Captain of the Privateer Lynx regarding the photo I took of it rounding the Chicago Harbor Light in the rain. She is a schooner from New Hampshire that was constructed by Rockport Marine in Rockport Maine and launched on July 28th, 2001. Here is a another photo of this beautiful ship out on Lake Michigan. For more information please visit the ship's website at <a href="http://www.privateerlynx.com/">www.privateerlynx.com</a>.</p>

<p>A sudden downpour came in during the parade of sails in Chicago, but that didn't ruin our day. More photos to come.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was contacted by the Captain of this beautiful ship and learned she is the Privateer Lynx from New Hampshire. Upon further investigation the ship on her port side is the Madeline, and the ship dissapearing behind the lighthouse is the Friends Good Will.</p>
