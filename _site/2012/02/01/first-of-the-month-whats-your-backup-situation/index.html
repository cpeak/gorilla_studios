    <h3>First Of The Month - What's Your Backup Situation?</h3>
    <p>It's the first of the month - a great time to double check how your backups are doing.  My full time job is doing IT support so I see first-hand the dangers of either not backing up data or not checking your backups. Remember: just backing up your data is not good enough! <strong>CHECK IT</strong>!</p><p>How do you know your backup set is good? Most people don't check until they are already in hot water. Don't gamble with your data - run a 'fire-drill' every few months.  Pretend your main computer just crashed - shut it down and walk through what it's going to take to get you back on your feet.  Do you have a spare machine incase your motherboard fails? Do you have a spare hard drive to swap in if its a drive crash? Do you have your software installers and more importantly the license keys?  What applications do you need to get your workflow going? Planning this out before something crashes, that way when it does you know what to do.</p><p><em>Remember</em> - backup drives are just as fallible as internal drives.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket by storing all your documents in one external 'backup drive'.  You are not protected until your data is on two separate devices. In my experience you can usually expect hard drives to last between 3 and 5 years, however if it is a mission critical drive I would replace them every 1 or 2 years.</p><p>Backup solutions are very affordable these days so there is no excuse for not having at least something in place.  Check your backups on the first of the month and run your fire drill once every few months, that way if something ever happens you'll be in great shape.</p>
