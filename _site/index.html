                    <p>Happy New Year from Gorilla-Studios!</p><p>Since its January 1st and everyone under the sun is making resolutions, I've decided to jump on the bandwagon. This year I am going to try to complete a Photo 365 Challenge (tip o' the hat to <a href='http://www.kandirich.com'>Kandi Rich</a> for the inspiration).  If you want a project to push you all year be sure to checkout <a href='http://content.photojojo.com/tips/7-new-year-projects/#more-32021'>Photojojo's 7 New Year Projects</a> for some great inspiration if you're not quite up to a 365 day photo challenge. My other resolution is to post more often and keep working on the site. Last year was spent focusing on getting married and my new full-time job, so this year I am going to set aside time to grow my site and skills the best I can.</p><p>Heres to 2013!</p>

                    <p>Any craftsman will practice his skills, working on them over and over. Any photographer worth their salt will practice not only taking photos, but working with their equipment as well. I have seen on many blogs posts talking about swapping lenses quickly, but they always say practice in favorable conditions in good light. Lets take practicing lens swapping a bit further.</p><p>I was out yesterday walking through the snow,  getting used to my new Black Rapid Double Strap, keeping sharp with handling gear in windy cold conditions, and just enjoying the scenery when I decided to swap from my wide angle to a telephoto. Problem was I couldnt set my bag down because I was in the middle of a field in deep snow. <i>Here's the challenge:</i> swap out your lens with out setting down any gear, then try to do it with gloves on. Try it in the dark with minmal light. Could you do it by feel alone? Whats it like handling your lenses and caps with your gloves on? Practice working in adverse conditions before you find yourself in them not knowing what to do.</p><p>Remember to keep practicing not only taking and composing photos, but working with your gear. The better you know it the faster you will be in the field when it counts.</p>

                    <p>I finally took my recently acquired Celestron Ultima 11 Schmidt-Cass telescope out for a test run to get a feel for using it in the field. Everything setup easily and I got the moon in sight quickly, but I had some initial focusing problems. About a half hour of tinkering around and I finally got it in focus and was thoroughly impressed with the clarity. The Celestron has an 11" mirror with a rough focal length of 2800mm. Using a 26mm Plossl eyepiece puts us at roughly 108x magnification (2800mm / 26mm). I couldn't help just gazing through the eyepiece for some time, getting used to tracking the moon manually (I still need to learn how to properly polar align the scope and use the auto tracking). Finally I pulled out my trusty EOS 10D and mounted it to the scope. I refocused and started shooting, right around 1/90th at ISO 200. I locked the mirror up and used a remote as to avoid shake, but the first round of photos were all soft. Im not sure if it was a mirror shake problem or the images were just plain out of focus. I had a hard time getting locked in with the telescopes focus knob, clearly its going to take some practice. Heres the 'best' of the out of focus images from tonight:</p><img src='/images/celestron_test.png' /><p>That was shot at ISO 200 for 1/90th of a second with the mirror lock enabled. If I understand correctly it has a focal length of f/16. This image was also completely un-cropped - the telescope has so much power I cannot fit the moon into the frame all at once. To get full lunar images I either need to stitch multiple images together or purchase a telecompressor. It was a relatively clear night, but I did shoot with a lot of ambient light from the subdivision. I may take it out tomorrow for another shoot, stay tuned!</p>

                    <img src='/images/celestron.png' /><p>Today I liberated my fathers Celestron Ultima 11" Schmidt-Cass telescope which had been collecting dust for some time. I picked up an adapter for my Canon, so over the next few months I will be seriously exploring astrophotography.  I have previously used a low-grade Quantaray 600-1000mm scope for lunar photography, needless to say this is quite an upgrade - the Celestron has a focal distance of 2800mm (if I understand the specs correctly). I will keep posting my experiences and results soon.  Stay tuned.</p>

While the camera did not survive, thankfully it looks like the lioness didn't suffer any injuries from her curiosity.</p>

                    <img class='img_center' alt='Half Moon shot on July 27th, 2012 with a Canon EOS 10D + Quantaray 600-1000mm' src='/images/half_moon.jpg' /><p>Here are two things you can do to give your astro and night photography a little boost.  First is to pair your cable release with the camera's 'Mirror Lock' function. Simply go into your DSLR's custom functions and select Mirror Lock. By enabling this, when you press the shutter release the mirror swings up and out of the way locking into position and holding in place. You then have to press the button again to open the shutter and make the exposure. After the photo is taken the mirror swings back into place as normal. What this does is eliminate any shaking or movement involved when the mirror flips up.  Normally during the day time and during normal photos this movement does not matter, but when you are trying to keep the camera as steady as possible during a long exposure at night it makes a large difference.</p><p>Second is to use a UV/Haze filter. These filters cut down on UV light and haze that can impact image quality. Sometimes the difference isn't that great, but when I shot a before and after tonight I was impressed with what a cheap $20 UV filter did.  The moon was low in the sky when the shot was taken, increasing the amount of atmospheric haze to shoot through.  Both images were taken within a minute of each other, on my Canon 10D paired with a Quantaray 600-1000mm super telephoto, extended to 1000mm, <i>f</i>/16 at 1/30th of a second, ISO 100. On the left the mirror was not locked and the filter was not on the lens. On the right the mirror-lock function is enabled and the filter is on. Without the mirror-lock the first image was shaken enough to impact the sharpness, and you can also see the clarity difference as well.</p><img alt='Unfiltered with no mirror lock vs. UV/Haze filter with Mirror Lock' src='/images/moon_example.jpg' />

                    <p>One lesson I have learned in my years of shooting is that you should always be ready to improvise. It's a good idea to plan your shoots to get a good idea of what you want to accomplish but you always have to be ready to throw it out the window and get what you can.</p><p>I went out after work last Friday and decided to go down to Navy Pier and take some dusk shots of the Ferris Wheel and spinning swings. I wanted to catch them as the sun was going down and use a slower shutter speed to capture some motion. After taking a few test shots I was approached by a security guard and he told me firmly that they did not allow tripods during high traffic periods 'due to safety concerns'. I was frustrated and voiced my displeasure since I was actually using it as a monopod, but rather than having a chat with the Chicago Police I decided to move along. Needless to say I was in a bad mood, but instead of just packing up and heading home I started walking up the lakefront. I knew there was a great park just north of Navy Pier with a beautiful view of the skyline and lots of boat activity, so I decided to try to see what I could get up there. Again I setup and started composing my shots, taking some test exposures and watching the sun sink farther and farther. Just as I started to feel good about everything a Chicago Police officer reported that the park was closing and ran everyone out. This was yet another opportunity to throw my hands up and pack it in. Thankfully I stayed cool and left the park and went down to the beach around the corner. After double-checking with the officer I found that it was open until 10 so I wouldn't have any problems. As the golden hour set in I started getting some great shots and all my frustrations just drifted away.</p><img alt='Chicago skyline at dusk' src='/images/chicago_skyline.jpg' /><p>This was the last shot before the sun finally went down, taken at 19mm <i>f</i>/8 for 30 seconds. I would have missed this opportunity had I gotten angry and just headed home.</p><img alt='' src='/images/flower_bug.jpg' /><p>Here is another great example. This photo was taken when I went out last summer looking for more Great Blue Herons that were nested near my house. I was walking along the Fox River looking at the tree line when the color of these flowers really caught my eye. I switched over to my 50mm macro lens and started photographing these bold flowers. I was just about to pack up when I noticed this bug on one flower, climbing the stamen. I would have totally missed this had I not had my eyes open.</p><p>Always be sure to have an idea of what you want to get before you even leave the house but keep your eyes and mind open to something completely different. Looking through my portfolio there are quite a few shots that were a complete surprise to me at the time. Whether its a scenery or lighting change, location change, equipment malfunction or whatever, one of the best tools you can have is being able to stay calm and get the shot that presents itself to you.</p>

                    <p>It looks like Wolf Camera is filing for bankruptcy - again.  I stopped by my local store and found out they are closing 'probably half' of their stores.  While they were never able to compete against online retailers in terms of cost, the customer service was always top notch.</p><p>I'm not sure exactly which and how many stores are closing, but the one in Batavia, IL is shutting down 'within the month' and is currently having a huge blowout sale.  I picked up about $200 worth of filters for about $40 bucks today.  Most of their inventory is picked clean already, but if you know what you're looking for be sure to stop by.</p>
