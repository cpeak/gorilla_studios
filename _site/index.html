                    <p>I hear a lot of less-experienced photographers bemoaning the fact that they don't have a particular lens, or their camera 'isn't good enough', and it always frustrates me. You don't need the latest 20+ Megapixel camera to produce great images. Keep practicing with the gear you have, and more importantly push yourself and try something you've never done before. For my Photo 365 project I decided to try to catch a droplet splashing out of water but I don't have a ring flash or enclosed soft-box - heck my tripod was in the trunk of my car with my wife at work.</p>
<p>Necessity is the mother of invention so I grabbed some things in the kitchen and setup a mini-studio. I used a glass of water, an eye dropper, a lamp as a secondary light, my flash &amp; sync cable, and ...a chopstick?</p>
<img src='/images/experiment.jpg' />
<p>I set the camera up on a plastic tupperware container as a makeshift tripod and switched over to manual focus mode since nothing would be moving. Looking through the camera I couldn't tell if I was in focus on the center of the water's surface, so I dipped the chopstick in dead center and focus locked on that.  I grabbed my cable release in one hand and the eye dropper in the other and tried to sync the drop to the shutter.  At first I tried the built-in timer but couldn't get the droplet to hit at the right time, so I resorted to dropping multiple drops not too far apart and releasing the shutter during.  It only took me a few shots to get the timing down. About 10 minutes of setup and a few minutes of shooting and I captured this one:</p>
<img src='/images/droplet.jpg' />
<p>Its not going to appear in any magazines thats for sure, but then again it was about 15 minutes with no additional equipment. No high-speed camera, no special lighting, just what I had in my camera bag and kitchen. <i>f</i>/19, 1/200th, ISO 100. This was just an experiment, I like to tinker around. Next time I will probably distill the water first so its free of impurities, and I may try a larger container so I can get more of a horizontal shot. I only spent a few minutes tinkering around in the kitchen, but I already have a better understanding of macro-photography setups, and how I can improve next time.</p>

                    <p>As previously mentioned, I have decided to participate in a Photo 365 Challenge.  I will be taking one photo a day for the entire 2013 calendar year, and posting them <a href='/photo365.html'>here</a> as well as my <a href='http://gorilla-studios.tumblr.com'>Tumblr feed</a>. I wanted to take this challenge so I would have my camera on me at all times, push myself as a photographer, and try some things I haven't done before. So far I am only 13 days in and already I am finding myself seeing things differently, looking for photos everywhere I go.</p>
<p>To make things a bit more challenging, I will limit myself to only a handfull of shots per day.  I have also turned off the automatic preview after each shot as a throwback to the old film days where you don't know your results until your in the dark-room. I'll make monthly posts about my progress, positive notes, frustrations,  etc..</p>

                    <p>Happy New Year from Gorilla-Studios!</p><p>Since its January 1st and everyone under the sun is making resolutions, I've decided to jump on the bandwagon. This year I am going to try to complete a Photo 365 Challenge (tip o' the hat to <a href='http://www.kandirich.com'>Kandi Rich</a> for the inspiration).  If you want a project to push you all year be sure to checkout <a href='http://content.photojojo.com/tips/7-new-year-projects/#more-32021'>Photojojo's 7 New Year Projects</a> for some great inspiration if you're not quite up to a 365 day photo challenge. My other resolution is to post more often and keep working on the site. Last year was spent focusing on getting married and my new full-time job, so this year I am going to set aside time to grow my site and skills the best I can.</p><p>Heres to 2013!</p>

                    <p>Any craftsman will practice his skills, working on them over and over. Any photographer worth their salt will practice not only taking photos, but working with their equipment as well. I have seen on many blogs posts talking about swapping lenses quickly, but they always say practice in favorable conditions in good light. Lets take practicing lens swapping a bit further.</p><p>I was out yesterday walking through the snow,  getting used to my new Black Rapid Double Strap, keeping sharp with handling gear in windy cold conditions, and just enjoying the scenery when I decided to swap from my wide angle to a telephoto. Problem was I couldnt set my bag down because I was in the middle of a field in deep snow. <i>Here's the challenge:</i> swap out your lens with out setting down any gear, then try to do it with gloves on. Try it in the dark with minmal light. Could you do it by feel alone? Whats it like handling your lenses and caps with your gloves on? Practice working in adverse conditions before you find yourself in them not knowing what to do.</p><p>Remember to keep practicing not only taking and composing photos, but working with your gear. The better you know it the faster you will be in the field when it counts.</p>

                    <p>I finally took my recently acquired Celestron Ultima 11 Schmidt-Cass telescope out for a test run to get a feel for using it in the field. Everything setup easily and I got the moon in sight quickly, but I had some initial focusing problems. About a half hour of tinkering around and I finally got it in focus and was thoroughly impressed with the clarity. The Celestron has an 11" mirror with a rough focal length of 2800mm. Using a 26mm Plossl eyepiece puts us at roughly 108x magnification (2800mm / 26mm). I couldn't help just gazing through the eyepiece for some time, getting used to tracking the moon manually (I still need to learn how to properly polar align the scope and use the auto tracking). Finally I pulled out my trusty EOS 10D and mounted it to the scope. I refocused and started shooting, right around 1/90th at ISO 200. I locked the mirror up and used a remote as to avoid shake, but the first round of photos were all soft. Im not sure if it was a mirror shake problem or the images were just plain out of focus. I had a hard time getting locked in with the telescopes focus knob, clearly its going to take some practice. Heres the 'best' of the out of focus images from tonight:</p><img src='/images/celestron_test.png' /><p>That was shot at ISO 200 for 1/90th of a second with the mirror lock enabled. If I understand correctly it has a focal length of f/16. This image was also completely un-cropped - the telescope has so much power I cannot fit the moon into the frame all at once. To get full lunar images I either need to stitch multiple images together or purchase a telecompressor. It was a relatively clear night, but I did shoot with a lot of ambient light from the subdivision. I may take it out tomorrow for another shoot, stay tuned!</p>

                    <img src='/images/celestron.png' /><p>Today I liberated my fathers Celestron Ultima 11" Schmidt-Cass telescope which had been collecting dust for some time. I picked up an adapter for my Canon, so over the next few months I will be seriously exploring astrophotography.  I have previously used a low-grade Quantaray 600-1000mm scope for lunar photography, needless to say this is quite an upgrade - the Celestron has a focal distance of 2800mm (if I understand the specs correctly). I will keep posting my experiences and results soon.  Stay tuned.</p>

Ed Hetherington shared a story via <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152269804305542.929748.117291240541'>his facebook page</a> about how a lioness decided to get up close and personal with his EOS 5D MkII. While the camera did not survive, thankfully it looks like the lioness didn't suffer any injuries from her curiosity.</p>

                    <img alt='Half Moon shot on July 27th, 2012 with a Canon EOS 10D + Quantaray 600-1000mm' class='img_center' src='/images/half_moon.jpg' /><p>Here are two things you can do to give your astro and night photography a little boost.  First is to pair your cable release with the camera's 'Mirror Lock' function. Simply go into your DSLR's custom functions and select Mirror Lock. By enabling this, when you press the shutter release the mirror swings up and out of the way locking into position and holding in place. You then have to press the button again to open the shutter and make the exposure. After the photo is taken the mirror swings back into place as normal. What this does is eliminate any shaking or movement involved when the mirror flips up.  Normally during the day time and during normal photos this movement does not matter, but when you are trying to keep the camera as steady as possible during a long exposure at night it makes a large difference.</p><p>Second is to use a UV/Haze filter. These filters cut down on UV light and haze that can impact image quality. Sometimes the difference isn't that great, but when I shot a before and after tonight I was impressed with what a cheap $20 UV filter did.  The moon was low in the sky when the shot was taken, increasing the amount of atmospheric haze to shoot through.  Both images were taken within a minute of each other, on my Canon 10D paired with a Quantaray 600-1000mm super telephoto, extended to 1000mm, <i>f</i>/16 at 1/30th of a second, ISO 100. On the left the mirror was not locked and the filter was not on the lens. On the right the mirror-lock function is enabled and the filter is on. Without the mirror-lock the first image was shaken enough to impact the sharpness, and you can also see the clarity difference as well.</p><img alt='Unfiltered with no mirror lock vs. UV/Haze filter with Mirror Lock' src='/images/moon_example.jpg' />
