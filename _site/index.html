                    <img alt='Half Moon shot on July 27th, 2012 with a Canon EOS 10D + Quantaray 600-1000mm' class='img_center' src='/images/half_moon.jpg' /><p>Here are two things you can do to give your astro and night photography a little boost.  First is to pair your cable release with the camera's 'Mirror Lock' function. Simply go into your DSLR's custom functions and select Mirror Lock. By enabling this, when you press the shutter release the mirror swings up and out of the way locking into position and holding in place. You then have to press the button again to open the shutter and make the exposure. After the photo is taken the mirror swings back into place as normal. What this does is eliminate any shaking or movement involved when the mirror flips up.  Normally during the day time and during normal photos this movement does not matter, but when you are trying to keep the camera as steady as possible during a long exposure at night it makes a large difference.</p><p>Second is to use a UV/Haze filter. These filters cut down on UV light and haze that can impact image quality. Sometimes the difference isn't that great, but when I shot a before and after tonight I was impressed with what a cheap $20 UV filter did.  The moon was low in the sky when the shot was taken, increasing the amount of atmospheric haze to shoot through.  Both images were taken within a minute of each other, on my Canon 10D paired with a Quantaray 600-1000mm super telephoto, extended to 1000mm, <i>f</i>/16 at 1/30th of a second, ISO 100. On the left the mirror was not locked and the filter was not on the lens. On the right the mirror-lock function is enabled and the filter is on. Without the mirror-lock the first image was shaken enough to impact the sharpness, and you can also see the clarity difference as well.</p><img alt='Unfiltered with no mirror lock vs. UV/Haze filter with Mirror Lock' src='/images/moon_example.jpg' />

                    <p>One lesson I have learned in my years of shooting is that you should always be ready to improvise. It's a good idea to plan your shoots to get a good idea of what you want to accomplish but you always have to be ready to throw it out the window and get what you can.</p><p>I went out after work last Friday and decided to go down to Navy Pier and take some dusk shots of the Ferris Wheel and spinning swings. I wanted to catch them as the sun was going down and use a slower shutter speed to capture some motion. After taking a few test shots I was approached by a security guard and he told me firmly that they did not allow tripods during high traffic periods 'due to safety concerns'. I was frustrated and voiced my displeasure since I was actually using it as a monopod, but rather than having a chat with the Chicago Police I decided to move along. Needless to say I was in a bad mood, but instead of just packing up and heading home I started walking up the lakefront. I knew there was a great park just north of Navy Pier with a beautiful view of the skyline and lots of boat activity, so I decided to try to see what I could get up there. Again I setup and started composing my shots, taking some test exposures and watching the sun sink farther and farther. Just as I started to feel good about everything a Chicago Police officer reported that the park was closing and ran everyone out. This was yet another opportunity to throw my hands up and pack it in. Thankfully I stayed cool and left the park and went down to the beach around the corner. After double-checking with the officer I found that it was open until 10 so I wouldn't have any problems. As the golden hour set in I started getting some great shots and all my frustrations just drifted away.</p><img alt='Chicago skyline at dusk' src='/images/chicago_skyline.jpg' /><p>This was the last shot before the sun finally went down, taken at 19mm <i>f</i>/8 for 30 seconds. I would have missed this opportunity had I gotten angry and just headed home.</p><img alt='' src='/images/flower_bug.jpg' /><p>Here is another great example. This photo was taken when I went out last summer looking for more Great Blue Herons that were nested near my house. I was walking along the Fox River looking at the tree line when the color of these flowers really caught my eye. I switched over to my 50mm macro lens and started photographing these bold flowers. I was just about to pack up when I noticed this bug on one flower, climbing the stamen. I would have totally missed this had I not had my eyes open.</p><p>Always be sure to have an idea of what you want to get before you even leave the house but keep your eyes and mind open to something completely different. Looking through my portfolio there are quite a few shots that were a complete surprise to me at the time. Whether its a scenery or lighting change, location change, equipment malfunction or whatever, one of the best tools you can have is being able to stay calm and get the shot that presents itself to you.</p>

                    <p>It looks like Wolf Camera is filing for bankruptcy - again.  I stopped by my local store and found out they are closing 'probably half' of their stores.  While they were never able to compete against online retailers in terms of cost, the customer service was always top notch.</p><p>I'm not sure exactly which and how many stores are closing, but the one in Batavia, IL is shutting down 'within the month' and is currently having a huge blowout sale.  I picked up about $200 worth of filters for about $40 bucks today.  Most of their inventory is picked clean already, but if you know what you're looking for be sure to stop by.</p>

                    <p>I have had lots of conversations over the years with friends and younger photographers about upgrading gear, and they always ask about what camera is 'better' or which does X better. As a beginner or amateur photographer guess what? The specs don't really matter. If you listen closely you'll hear the sound of thousands of Internet Trolls crying out <em>'Blasphemy!'</em>.</p><p>The other day a friend and I were discussing about what she should get as her first serious DSLR. She told me that the guy at Wolf Camera was going on about how Nikon has better low-light performance, but the Canon optics are better, blah blah blah. She got worried and wanted to know the real-world differences between a few entry to mid-level cameras. These clerks never seem to realize that they are splitting hairs and to a beginner it doesn't matter (and most of the time they don't understand). Do you really think to a beginner (or anyone really) it matters that camera X shoots .5fps faster than camera Y, or its sensor is 3MP more? No. Nobody can tell the difference between a 16MP photo and a 18.5MP photo when they are all uploaded onto Flickr.</p><p>I always laugh when car guys are comparing a BMW that can do 180MPh and a Mercedes that can do 182MPh. Yes that Merc is technically faster, but they are both high-performance machines that are really never going to be pushed to their limits. It's the same with cameras - the difference between a Canon EOS 60D and a Nikon D90 is going to be marginal to most beginner and amateur photographers. This Nikon may have 1MP more, or that Canon may be a hair better in low-light sensitivity, but guess what? They are both fantastic cameras that produce great images.</p><p>Yes it is an investment and you want to purchase the right camera to fit your needs since you will have it for years (I am *still* shooting with my 10D I purchased in 2003), but don't go overboard wringing your hands about the spec differences between a Rebel T2i and a D5000. Figure out what you want to use the camera for, buy it, and start having fun. Remember: its not the sensor, the lens, or the ultra-high ISO, or some whiz-bang feature that make the photograph - it's your eye, your gut, and your heart.</p><p>Stop worrying about all the new cameras coming out and forget about how this camera magazine said brand X was so much better. Instead of sitting in front of a computer reading spec sheets, review after review, and endless forum posts, take that time and go outside with <em>your camera</em>. Take some awesome shots with what you have - share it, talk about your art, and most of all, have fun with it.</p>

                    <p>A friend of mine recently purchased the new Canon EOS 5D MkIII and gave me a chance to check it out after dinner tonight. While this is not a full review, I wanted to share my initial thoughts. The camera feels absolutely solid, great to hold and the shutter release is extremely snappy. The large LCD panel on the rear of the camera is crisp and bright, photos looked amazing. What really blew me away was its low-light capabilities - I took a quick set of photos and was amazed at the clarity. Shots from ISO 12,000 up to the 25,600 max were clear, and certainly useable.</p><p>I really hope to get my hands on one for an extended period so I can do a full review, but for now I wanted to say that I am really impressed.  Soon I'll have a complete review with image and HD video samples, so stay tuned!</p>
