  <h3>Photo Of The Month</h3>
  <p>My favorite photo from August came from a small street festival in Westmont, IL. The Cadillac Cassanovas are a great three piece rockabilly band from the Chicagoland area who put on a great show. I was lucky enough back in May to shoot them at the Arcada in St. Charles, so when I saw that they were playing a cruise night not far from me I knew I had to grab the camera and head over to see them. This particular shot is a wonderful example of sticking to it and not leaving until the show is over, your cards or full, or your batteries are dead. The event was infront of a really ugly brick building, with a really distracting banner behind them, needless to say it wasn't the most photogenic show to shoot. Their first set was probably around 7 or so, and was in broad daylight. Really hard light, poor shooting conditions, I wasn't really happy with too many shots. I got a few, but overall nothing compared to the Arcada show. During the break between sets I walked around checking out the cool cars and cooling off a little bit, and almost decided to go home. Thankfully I didn't.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to meet the guys at the Arcada show, so I really try to do my best to get some great images for them, but I just wasn't feeling it that night. I decided to stick with it and see what I could get in the second set. As the sun started going down their stage lights started taking over. Using a faster shutter speed I started blackening out the background which was full of people. This particular photo is a portrait of Rick Uppling, who plays a huge upright bass. Rick is a great musician and always fun to photograph since he's usually jumping around, standing on his bass, or just generally hamming it up for the audience - so this shot was a bit of a surprise to me. The stage lights were to his left creating a great backlight that highlighted the edge of his face. I was careful not to cut off the headstock of his bass, as well as try to get both hands in shot.</p>

<p>They used a mix of colors in their lighting kit, so the color version of this photo was really strange looking. I ran it through Silver Efex Pro to convert it to black &amp; white and thats when the photo really jumped. My only critique is that I caught Carl's headstock poking into the left side of frame. Overall I really like this portrait and am really thankful that I stuck with it that night.</p>
